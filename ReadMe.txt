textures taken from star wars Dark Forces (1995)

collisions occur between all entities but best way to test them is to toggle duel fire mode by pressing 'f'

the projectiles and enemies are animated and the player animates if you toggle the S-foils from attack to normal and visa versa
 by pressing 't'. this will also change the speed of the veicle and change the fire rate*

by defult, the explosions on death are turned off because my computer cant handle them. turn them on by pressing 'e'
they do work.

after some time, the Luke (you) will see the thermal exhaust port infront of you and ties will stop spawning. you
must shoot the exhaust port to win the game (its not hard)

otherwise all else should work just as described in the A4 directions


*not fully implemented the gameplay changes. only movment speed
